        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>I’m currently in my third year as a BSIT student. Honestly, I didn’t choose this course by preference but out of necessity. If I had the chance, I’d choose political science every time. However, I see this as a milestone on my journey, and I’ll be graduating in September 2025. Afterward, I plan to pursue my true passion and work toward a degree in political science.
